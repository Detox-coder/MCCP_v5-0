   - Cross-platform compatible

## üìñ Usage

### Step 1: Basic Setup
1. Enter the **number of members** (1-50)
2. Set the **minimum meal count** threshold
3. Click "Setup Members" to proceed

### Step 2: Member Information
For each member, provide:
- **Name**: Member's display name
- **Meal Expenses**: Amount spent on meals
- **Grocery Expenses**: Amount spent on groceries
- **Meal Count**: Number of meals consumed

### Step 3: View Results
The calculator will display:
- **Summary Dashboard**: Key metrics and totals
- **Detailed Table**: Individual member breakdown
- **Payment Transactions**: Optimized settlement plan

### Example Scenario
```
Members: 4
Minimum Meals: 35

Member 1 (ALICE):
- Meal Expenses: ‚Çπ500
- Grocery Expenses: ‚Çπ200
- Meal Count: 40

Member 2 (BOB):
- Meal Expenses: ‚Çπ300
- Grocery Expenses: ‚Çπ150
- Meal Count: 30 ‚Üí (adjusted to 35)

[... and so on]
```

## üßÆ Algorithm

### Core Calculation Process

#### 1. **Input Validation & Adjustment**

```js
// Minimum meal enforcement
if (mealCount < minMeal) {
    mealCount = minMeal;
}
```

#### 2. **Rate Calculation**

```js
mealRate = totalMealExpenses / totalMealCount;
groceryRate = totalGroceryExpenses / totalMembers;
```

#### 3. **Individual Charges**

```js
member.mealCharge = member.mealCount * mealRate;
member.groceryCharge = groceryRate;
member.totalCharge = member.mealCharge + member.groceryCharge;
```

#### 4. **Balance Calculation**

```js
member.giveAndTake = member.totalExpenses - member.totalCharge;
```

#### 5. **Transaction Optimization**
- Groups members into givers (negative balance) and takers (positive balance)
- Optimizes payments to minimize transaction count
- Uses precision error handling (¬±0.5 tolerance)

### Mathematical Precision
- **Error Tolerance**: ¬±0.5 currency units
- **Floating Point Handling**: Proper rounding for currency calculations
- **Balance Verification**: Ensures total give equals total take

## üíª Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with flexbox/grid
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Pure JS implementation (no frameworks)

### Design Features
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Responsive layout system

## üìä Examples

### Sample Calculation

**Input:**
- 3 Members, Minimum 30 meals
- Alice: ‚Çπ600 meals, ‚Çπ200 grocery, 35 meals
- Bob: ‚Çπ400 meals, ‚Çπ150 grocery, 25 meals ‚Üí (adjusted to 30)
- Carol: ‚Çπ300 meals, ‚Çπ100 grocery, 40 meals

**Output:**
- Meal Rate: ‚Çπ12.38/meal
- Grocery Rate: ‚Çπ150/person
- Alice owes: ‚Çπ0 (balanced)
- Bob pays Carol: ‚Çπ85.71
- Total Error: ‚Çπ0.02
